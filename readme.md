Important Notes:

Prior to May 30, 2022, it was possible to connect to Gmail’s SMTP server using your regular Gmail password if “2-step verification” was activated. For a higher security standard, Google now requires you to use an “App Password”.

This is a 16-digit passcode that is generated in your Google account and allows less secure apps or devices that don’t support 2-step verification to sign in to your Gmail Account.
